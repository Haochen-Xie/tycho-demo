<h2>Exercises Overview:
Building an RCP application in 5 step-by-step exercises</h2>

The hands-on exercises will guide you through setting up a 
typical tycho project for an RCP application.<br/>
<ul>
<li>We start from scratch with a small "Hello World" RCP plugin,</li>
<li>then we add a simple unit test to make sure the plugin works</li>
<li>then we add a feature for grouping the plugins we want to deliver.</li>
<li>Next, we create a p2 repository/update site containing our feature(s)
and bundles,</li>
<li>and finally we add a product with 
native launcher binaries, branding etc. for which we create pre-packaged
zip installations.</li>
</ul>
