<h2>Exercises Overview:
Building an e4 RCP application in five step-by-step exercises</h2>

The hands-on exercises will guide you through setting up a 
typical Tycho project for an e4 RCP application.<br/>
<ul>
<li>We start from scratch with a small "Hello World" e4 RCP plugin,</li>
<li>Add a simple unit test to make sure the plugin works, and</li>
<li>Create a feature for grouping the plugins we want to deliver.</li>
<li>Then, we create a p2 repository/update site containing our feature(s)
and bundles, and </li>
<li>Finally, build a self-contained installable product complete with native launcher binaries, branding etc.</li>
</ul>
